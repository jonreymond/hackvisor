# Main topics : Real time analsis and generation 

- side panel instead 

## Keywords (focused on realtime /now )
Taking keywords from the conversation and guiding the advisor to get to the keywords which map to certain products (promoto cross selling)
- checking for biasses -> classifications that point towards a bias 
- saving time for checking nodes 
- can be more focused on the conversation 

## Chunks (focused more after processing)
We want to give the model chunks in combination with relevant client data and reasoning per combination. Where we are mostly focused on providing the advisor
with : 
- missing opportunies 
- reasoning examples 
- product suggestions
This approach is more focused on improvise the advisor himself and use it in self-development.
And using the chunks to send a conversation summary to the client
