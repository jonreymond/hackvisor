# From GenAI to Agentic AI: Hacking the Future of Banking

## Introduction:
Agentic AI is the next hype around the path to adoption of institutions with generative AI technologies. We as Raiffeisen see lots of opportunities that can be adressed with these new capabilities. Supported by Microsoft and the Microsoft tech stack you inspire with new solutions to adopt these new possibilities to gain effectivity and efficiency.

#### What is the current problem?
As we see broad adoption you can choose out of a collection of possibilities or develop your own approach. The most interesting problems are
* Semantic Real Estate Search: Create a agent driven chat-based app for customers to input preferences and/or images and search and display matching new listings.
* Augmenting Advisors: Provide agents that support advisors during a meeting based on real-time data and client history.
* Optimize meeting summaries  with AI agents: Develop an app to record, transcribe Swiss German audio, and summarize using Agentic AI Workflows that ensure accuracy and completeness.
* Retirement Planning Chatbot: Enhance a chatbot to provide retirement advice, projections and product recommendations using multimodal LLMs.
* ESG Research and Reporting: Develop a system to analyze ESG factors using public information.

#### Users of a solution: 
The users will be different from solved problems. Most address usage through internal users or advisors. Often the solution focusses on augmenting the customer experience.

#### Use case of a solution: 
You choose one of the described use cases or choose an own scenario where you think agentic AI can boost the use case.
